# English course form

[Click to find out how it works!](https://eng-course-form.netlify.app/)

This task involved creating a form that incorporates elements with a design consistent with the neumorphism trend, which includes the appropriate use of shadows.

Functionalities:

- The form consists of 4 stages that can be freely navigated between,
- Each form stage displays a progress bar,
- It includes a dropdown list implemented using a solution different from select,
- Validation occurs immediately after entering data.

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; gap: 5px">
    <img style="width: 23%; height: auto" src="./src/assets/Capture - page 01.JPG"/>
    <img style="width: 23%; height: auto" src="./src/assets/Capture - page 02.JPG"/>
    <img style="width: 23%; height: auto" src="./src/assets/Capture - page 03.JPG"/>
    <img style="width: 23%; height: auto" src="./src/assets/Capture - page 04.JPG"/>
</div>
