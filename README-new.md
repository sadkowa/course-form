[Click to find out how it works!](https://youtu.be/JoUjf8Hv8aw)

This task involved creating a form that incorporates elements with a design consistent with the neumorphism trend, which includes the appropriate use of shadows.

Functionalities:

- The form consists of 4 stages that can be freely navigated between,
- Each form stage displays a progress bar,
- It includes a dropdown list implemented using a solution different from select,
- Validation occurs immediately after entering data.
